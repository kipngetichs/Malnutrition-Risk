# Saving Tiny Lives: Fighting Malnutrition in Rural Kenya!
# Early Detection of Malnutrition Risk in Children Under Five Using Community-Based Data
# Situation
Malnutrition is a silent thief stealing health from kids under five in rural Kenya! Picture babies too weak to smile, hungry every day in places like Bungoma. In this project, we dive into data from 235,960 children, where 63,040 are at high risk of fading away. We’ll uncover why poverty, no food, no water affects malnutrition and how to save them.
# Task
As a data analyst, my role was to find out what’s causing malnutrition and stop it. I had to check things like poor diets, low income, and no healthcare to spot kids in danger. I teamed up with my group for 2 weeks  to finish this project. Our goals were to find the big problems, build an early warning system, help nurses act fast, and send resources to the neediest kids.
# Action
I started by grabbing data from our table, [Healthcare].[dbo].[Cleaned dataset healthcare]. Using SQL Server, I cleaned it up and fixed missing numbers and removed duplicates to make it tidy. Then, I analyzed it with SQL to find patterns, like why 70% of kids eat boring diets or 60% have no clean water. Finally, I built a bright dashboard in Power BI, a super tool, to show the crisis clearly. Check out the dashboard preview below!
