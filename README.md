# Saving Tiny Lives: Fighting Malnutrition in Rural Kenya!
# Early Detection of Malnutrition Risk in Children Under Five Using Community-Based Data
# Situation
Malnutrition is a silent thief stealing health from kids under five in rural Kenya! Picture babies too weak to smile, hungry every day in places like Bungoma. In this project, we dive into data from 235,960 children, where 63,040 are at high risk of fading away. We’ll uncover why poverty, no food, no water affects malnutrition and how to save them.
# Task
As a data analyst, my role was to find out what’s causing malnutrition and stop it. I had to check things like poor diets, low income, and no healthcare to spot kids in danger. I teamed up with my group for 2 weeks  to finish this project. Our goals were to find the big problems, build an early warning system, help nurses act fast, and send resources to the neediest kids.
# Action
I started by grabbing data from our table, [Healthcare].[dbo].[Cleaned dataset healthcare]. Using SQL Server, I cleaned it up and fixed missing numbers and removed duplicates to make it tidy. Then, I analyzed it with SQL to find patterns, like why 70% of kids eat boring diets or 60% have no clean water. Finally, I built a bright dashboard in Power BI, a super tool, to show the crisis clearly. Check out the dashboard preview below!

# Results
- Total Children: 235,960 kids, with 63,040 (26.7%) at high risk of malnutrition.
- Poverty Problem: 21.2% of families earn below KES 18,000 a year, struggling to feed six people.
- Weak Growth: Kids are too light (Weight-for-Age: -3.0) and thin (Weight-for-Height: -2.0).
- Food Issues: 70% have low diet variety (under 4 food groups), and breastfeeding stops at 11.5 months, not 24.
- No Basics:
  - 60% have no clean water hence sickness hurts them.
  - 60% lack toilets hence germs make it worse.
  - 70% can’t get healthcare hence no help when sick.
  - 60% have no markets hence food’s hard to find.
  - 70% face food shortages hence hunger never stops.
- Biggest Need: Babies 0-2, across all rural areas, with parents who’ve had little school (mostly Primary or None).
- Warning System: Our model spots kids with low z-scores and no water ,63,040 need us now!
# Recommendations
# Main Recommendations for Solving the Problem:
- Screen every baby under two for low weight and send food packs to 63,040 high-risk kids fast.
- Give water kits to 60% without clean water to stop sickness now.
- Teach moms to breastfeed longer and mix simple foods for better diets.
- Build wells and toilets for 60% in need, and bring mobile clinics to 70% without doctors.
- Start a smart alert system to catch malnutrition early and save lives.
# Reflection
This project taught me how to pull together as a team, sharing jobs to meet our 2 weeks deadline. I learned to ask nurses and leaders what they need, like easy alerts, which made our dashboard a lifesaver. Working together, we spotted big gaps like 70% with no food and found ways to help. I got better at SQL and Power BI, but most of all, I’m fired up to keep helping kids grow strong!
